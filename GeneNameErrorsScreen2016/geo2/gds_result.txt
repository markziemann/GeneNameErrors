105. Liver ChIP-seq analysis in FGF19-treated mice reveals SHP as a global transcriptional partner of SREBP-2
(Submitter supplied) Background: Fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19) is an intestinal hormone that mediates postprandial metabolic responses in the liver. The unusual orphan nuclear receptor, Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), acts as a co-repressor for many transcriptional factors and has been implicated in diverse biological pathways including FGF19-mediated repression of bile acid synthesis. To explore global functions of SHP in mediating FGF19 action, we identify genome-wide SHP binding sites in hepatic chromatin in mice treated with vehicle or FGF19 by ChIP-seq analysis. more...

110. Whole-body transcriptomics of Nasonia vitripennis females as they respond to sex allocation cues
(Submitter supplied) Linking the evolution of the phenotype to the underlying genotype is a key aim of evolutionary genetics and is crucial to our understanding of how natural selection shapes a trait. Here we consider the genetic basis of sex allocation behaviour in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis using a transcriptomics approach. Females allocate offspring sex in line with Local Mate Competition (LMC) theory. Female-biased sex ratios are produced when one or few females lay eggs on a patch. As the number of females contributing offspring to a patch increases, less female-biased sex ratios are favoured. We contrasted the transcriptomic responses of females as they oviposit under conditions known to influence sex allocation: foundress number (a social cue) and the state of the host (parasitised or not). We found, that when females encounter other females on a patch, or assess host quality with their ovipositors, the resulting changes in sex allocation is not associated with significant changes in whole-body gene expression. We also found that the gene expression changes produced by females, as they facultatively allocate sex in response to a host cue and a social cue, are very closely correlated. We expanded the list of candidate genes associated with oviposition behaviour in Nasonia, some of which may be involved in fundamental processes underlying the ability to facultatively allocate sex, including sperm storage and utilisation.

113. microRNAs and isomiRs repertoire in poricne endometrium revealed by Illumina sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), known to modulate gene expression through post-transcriptional mechanisms, were implied in regulation of early pregnancy events including maternal recognition of pregnancy and implantation. To characterize complex transcriptomic changes in expression of miRNAs in pregnant and cyclic endometria collected on days 12, 16 and 20 was analyzed using Illumina deep sequencing. This research showed repertoire of pregnancy-related miRNAs in porcine endometrium during initial stages of conceptus implantation and during the estrous cycle and sheds light on miRNA-mediated gene expression regulation mechanism at the maternal-conceptus interface.

127. Single cell RNA-Seq of Hira-KO and control MII oocytes [Gdf9-Cre+]
(Submitter supplied) The integrity of chromatin, which provides a dynamic template for all DNA related processes in eukaryotes, is maintained through replication dependent and independent assembly pathways. To address the role of replication independent histone deposition, we deleted the histone H3.3 chaperone Hira in developing mouse oocytes. We show that chromatin of non-replicative developing oocytes is highly dynamic, and that lack of continuous H3.3/H4 deposition alters chromatin structure, resulting in increased DNase I sensitivity, the accumulation of DNA damage, and, ultimately, a severe fertility phenotype. more...

159. Panoramix enforces piRNA-dependent co-transcriptional silencing (small RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a small RNA-based innate immune system that defends germ cell genomes against transposons. In Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here we show that CG9754 is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. more...

178. Canonical poly(A) polymerase activity promotes the decay of a wide variety of mammalian nuclear RNAs
(Submitter supplied) The human nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 has been implicated in the decay of nuclear noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). In addition, PABPN1 stimulates hyperadenylation by poly(A) polymerase, and this activity is thought to be required for decay. Here, we inactivated hyperadenylation by two distinct mechanisms and examined changes in gene expression in HEK293 cells by RNAseq. We observed the upregulation of various ncRNAs, including snoRNA host genes, primary miRNA transcripts, and upstream antisense RNAs, confirming that hyperadenylation is broadly required for the degradation of PABPN1-targets. more...

(Submitter supplied) Pineal function follows a 24-hour schedule, dedicated to the conversion of night and day into a hormonal signal, melatonin. In mammals, 24-hour changes in pineal activity are controlled by a neural pathway that includes the central circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the superior cervical ganglia (SCG), which innervate the pineal gland. In this study, we have generated the first next-generation RNA sequencing evidence of neural control of the daily changes in the pineal transcriptome. more...

254. Patterns of somatic uniparental disomy identify novel tumor suppressor genes in colorectal cancer
(Submitter supplied) The aim of this study is to establish an integrative profiling of recurrent UPDs/UPPs, CNAs and genome-wide methylation status in sporadic CRC. Our results indicate that regions showing high frequencies of UPDs/UPPs mostly coincide with regions typically involved in genomic losses such as chromosome arms 1p, 5q, 8p, 14q, 17p, 18q, 20p, and 22q. Of these, chromosome arms 5q, 14q, 17p, and 20p preferentially showed UPDs/UPPs over genomic losses suggesting that tumor cells must maintain the disomic state of certain genes to favor cellular fitness. more...

260. Identification of direct target genes of the Neurospora crassa essential plant biomass deconstruction transcription factors CLR-1, CLR-2 and XLR-1 (ChIP-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) abstract: The plant cell wall is composed of many complex polymers, and its deconstruction requires an equally complex orchestration of a wide array of enzymes.  In Neurospora crassa, clr-1, clr-2 and xlr-1 have been identified as the key transcription factors involved in cell wall breakdown.  In order to define their regulons, we performed ChIPseq upon these three transcription factors.  CLR-1, CLR-2 and XLR-1 each bind to the most highly and differentially expressed gene populations, which include the cellulases for the CLRs and the hemicellulases for XLR-1. more...

264. Comparative whole-transcriptomic analysis between normal and AKAP-Lbc-depleted human embryonic stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have the unique property of immortality, ability to infinitely self-renew and survive in vitro. In contrast to tumor-deribed cells, their immortality are free from any genomic abberations. Instead, they depend on the AKAP-Lbc/Rho signaling cascade. To understand the downstream way, we performed RNA-seq analyses between normal and AKAP-Lbc-depleted hESCs using the doxycyclin-inducible gene silensing strategy.

272. Regulatory Rewiring Confers Serotype-Specific Hyper-Virulence in the Human Pathogen Group A Streptococcus
(Submitter supplied) We sequenced mRNA transcripts from three isogenic M3 serotype GAS strains, parental (MGAS10870), complement (10870::rocAM1), and deletion (10870ΔrocA).  There were no significant changes between the parental and revertant strain.  Comparison of the parental and complemented strain revealed several virulence factors were up-regulated in the parental strain where RocA function was diminished.  We concluded that RocA, through direct or indirect mechanisms, is able to control numerous virulence genes and this lack of RocA regulation increases expression of virulence factors, which contributes to the hyper-virulent state of serotype M3 GAS.

We found that restricting glucose or otherwise reducing the activity of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway can lead to improved proliferation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking mtDNA and that the transcriptional response to mtDNA loss is reduced in cells with diminished PKA activity. more...

317. Viral nucleases reveal an mRNA degradation-transcription feedback loop in mammalian cells
(Submitter supplied) Gamma-herpesviruses encode a cytoplasmic mRNA-targeting endonuclease, termed SOX, that cleaves the majority of mRNAs within a cell.  Cleaved fragments are subsequently degraded by the cellular mRNA degradation machinery.  Here, we reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay by altering levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in the nucleus.  Measurements of both RNAPII recruitment to promoters and nascent mRNA synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in SOX-expressing cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Transcription factor-mediated reprogramming is a powerful method to study cell fate changes. In this work, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Gata6 can initiate reprograming of multiple cell types to induced extraembryonic endoderm (iXEN) cells. Intriguingly, Gata6 is sufficient to drive iXEN cells from mouse pluripotent cells and differentiated neural cells. Furthermore, GATA6 induction in human ES (hES) cells also downregulates pluripotency gene expression and upregulates extraembryonic endoderm genes, revealing a conserved function in mediating this cell fate switch. more...

To interrogate processes that determine these distinct phenotypes and their inheritance pattern, we generated somatic cell fusions and performed integrated genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation and chromatin) profiling. We found that the basal-like trait is generally dominant and it is largely defined by epigenetic repression of luminal transcription factors. more...

380. N6-methyladenosine Modulates Messenger RNA Translation Efficiency
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal messenger (mRNA) modification in mammalian mRNA. This modification is reversible and non-stoichiometric, which potentially adds an additional layer of variety and dynamic control of mRNA metabolism. The m6A-modified mRNA can be selectively recognized by the YTH family “reader” proteins. The preferential binding of m6A-containing mRNA by YTHDF2 is known to reduce the stability of the target transcripts; however, the exact effects of m6A on translation has yet to be elucidated. more...

398. Molecular signatures of heterogeneous stem cell populations are resolved by linking single cell functional assays to single cell gene expression
(Submitter supplied) The discovery of significant heterogeneity in the self-renewal durability of adult haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has challenged our understanding of the molecules involved in population maintenance throughout life.  Gene expression studies in bulk populations are difficult to interpret since multiple HSC subtypes are present and HSC purity is typically less than 50% of the input cell population.  Numerous groups have therefore turned to studying gene expression profiles of single HSCs, but again these studies are limited by the purity of the input fraction and an inability to directly ascribe a molecular program to a durable self-renewing HSC.  Here we combine single cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single cell gene expression assays to gain the first insight into the gene expression program of HSCs that possess durable self-renewal.  This approach can be used in other stem cell systems and sets the stage for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions.

443. mRNA profiling reveals determinants of trastuzumab efficiency in HER2-positive breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) The intention was to detect genes that are determining trastuzumab efficiency in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines with different resistance phenotypes. While BT474 should be sensitive to the drug treatment, HCC1954 is expected to be resistant due to a PI3K mutation. The cell line BTR50 has been derived from BT474 and was cultured to be resistant as well. Based on RNA-Seq data, we performed differential expression analyses on these breast cancer cell lines with and without trastuzumab treatment. more...

448. RAR/RXR binding dynamics distinguishes pluripotency from differentiation-associated cis-regulatory elements
(Submitter supplied) In mouse embryonic cells, a retinoic acid (RA) stimulation triggers a massive change of gene expression leading the pluripotent, proliferating cells to a lineage-specific differentiation process. The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) plays a key role in this response by inhibiting pluripotency-maintaining genes and simultaneously activating some major actors of cell differentiation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this dual regulation, we performed joint RAR/RXR ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq time series during the first 48 hours of the RA-induced Primitive Endoderm differentiation process in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells. more...

450. Self-organization of polarized cerebellar plate neuroepithelium in three-dimensional culture of human pluripotent stem cells
(Submitter supplied) During cerebellar development, the main portion of the cerebellar plate neuroepithelium (NE) gives birth to Purkinje cells and interneurons, while the germinal zone at its dorsal edge, called the rhombic lip (RL), generates granule cells and cerebellar nuclei neurons. However, it remains elusive how these components work together to generate the intricate structure of the cerebellar anlage. In this study, we found that a polarized cerebellar anlage structure self-organizes in three-dimensional (3D) human ES cell (hESC) culture. more...

467. Intestinal microbiota composition modulates choline bioavailability from diet and accumulation of the pro-atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide
(Submitter supplied) Choline is a water-soluble nutrient essential for human life. Gut microbial metabolism of choline results in the production of trimethylamine (TMA), which upon absorption by the host is converted in the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).

472. Transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression in 4-day-old WT and athb1-1 mutant seedlings grown under short day conditions
(Submitter supplied) To understand which genes acts downstream AtHB1 affecting hypocotyl growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed transcriptional profiles of 4-day-old seedlings grown in a short-day regime comparing wild-type with athb1-1 mutant plants. These results show that some of the AtHB1-regulated genes modulate cell elongation, particularly cell wall composition and elongation, or encode proteins that serve as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur for early seedling growth.

501. Unraveling determinants of transcription factor binding outside the core binding site
(Submitter supplied) Binding of transcription factors (TFs) to regulatory sequences is a pivotal step in the control of gene expression. Despite many advances in the characterization of sequence motifs recognized by TFs, our ability to quantitatively predict TF binding to different regulatory sequences is still limited. Here, we present a novel experimental assay termed BunDLE-seq that provides quantitative measurements of TF binding to thousands of fully designed sequences of 200 bp in length within a single experiment. more...

502. RNA-seq Analysis of Mineralizing IDG-SW3 Cultures with Mature Osteocyte Characteristics
(Submitter supplied) We differentiated the murine IDG-SW3 cell line for 28 days until the cells displayed a mature osteocyte-like phenotype. Triplicate cultures of the IDG-SW3 cells were then treated with 50nM PTH (1-34) or vehicle control (PBS) for 24 hours. RNA was harvested from the cultures and used to perform RNA Seq analysis. We found that many genes previously shown to be markers of the osteocyte phenotype were strongly downregulated in response to PTH treatment. more...

503. Transcriptional control in Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique and other marine bacterial taxa
(Submitter supplied) Bacteria respond to stimuli in the environment using transcriptional control, but this may not be the case for most marine bacteria having small, streamlined genomes.  Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique, a cultivated representative of the SAR11 clade, which is the most abundant clade in the oceans 4, has a small, streamlined genome and possesses an unusually small number of transcriptional regulators.  This observation leads to the hypothesis that transcriptional control is low in Pelagibacter and limits its response to environmental conditions. more...

504. Gene expression profiling of wildtype vs. transgenic mice expressing the cardiac specific genetically encoded FRET biosensor Epac1-PLN
(Submitter supplied) 3’,5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an ubiquitous second messenger which regulates multiple physiological functions by acting in distinct subcellular microdomains. Although several targeted cAMP biosensors have been developed and used in cell lines or neonatal cardiomyocytes, it is unclear whether such biosensors can be successfully used in vivo, especially in the context of disease. Here, we generated the first transgenic mouse model expressing a targeted cAMP sensor (Epac1-PLN) and analyzed microdomain-specific second messenger dynamics in the vicinity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). more...

(Submitter supplied) Scl/Tal1 confers hemogenic competence and prevents cardiomyogenesis in embryonic endothelium. Here we show that Scl both directly activates a broad gene regulatory network required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HS/PC) development, and represses transcriptional regulators required for cardiogenesis. Cardiac repression occurs during a short developmental window through Scl binding to distant cardiac enhancers that harbor H3K4me1 at this stage. more...

562. Genome-wide analysis of microRNAs and their targets involving in leaf senescence of rice
(Submitter supplied) Enhancing grain production of rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a top priority in ensuring food security for human being. One approach to increase yield is to delay leaf senescence and to extend the available time for photosynthesis. microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators for aging and cellular senescence in eukayotes. However, miRNAs and their roles in rice leaf senescence remain unexplored. Here, we report identification of miRNAs and their putative target genes by deep sequencing of six small RNA libraries, six RNA-seq libraries and two degradome libraries from the leaves of two super hybrid rice, Nei-2-You 6 (N2Y6, age-resistant rice) and Liang-You-Pei 9 (LYP9, age-sensitive rice). more...

594. NF-κB-direct activation of microRNAs with repressive effects on monocyte-specific genes is critical for osteoclast differentiation
(Submitter supplied) In this study, analysis of miRNA expression changes in osteoclast differentiation from human primary monocytes revealed the rapid upregulation of two miRNA clusters, miR-212/132 and miR-99b/let-7e/125a. We demonstrate that they negatively target monocyte-specific and immunomodulatory genes like TNFAIP3, IGF1R and IL15. Depletion of these miRNAs inhibits osteoclast differentiation and upregulates their targets. more...

699. UBL5 is essential for pre-mRNA splicing and sister chromatid cohesion in human cells
(Submitter supplied) UBL5 is an atypical ubiquitin-like protein, whose function in metazoans remains largely unexplored. We show that UBL5 is required for sister chromatid cohesion maintenance in human cells. UBL5 primarily associates with spliceosomal proteins, and UBL5 depletion decreases pre-mRNA splicing efficiency, leading to globally enhanced intron retention. Defective sister chromatid cohesion is a general consequence of dysfunctional pre-mRNA splicing, resulting from the selective downregulation of the cohesion protection factor Sororin. more...

723. Modeling Luminal breast cancer heterogeneity: Combination therapy to suppress hormone receptor negative cells in Luminal disease
(Submitter supplied) Many Luminal breast cancers are heterogeneous, containing substantial numbers of estrogen (ER-) and progesterone (PR-) receptor-negative cells among the ER+PR+ ones. Currently, the Basal-like ER-PR- Luminobasal subpopulation in Luminal disease is not targeted for treatment. To address the relationships between ER+PR+ and ER-PR- cells in Luminal cancers and tightly control their ratios, we have generated isogenic pure Luminal (pLUM) and pure Luminobasal (pLB) cells from the same parental Luminal human breast cancer cell line. more...

(Submitter supplied) Iron is essential for many cellular processes and is required by bacteria for replication. To acquire iron from the host, pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria secrete siderophores, including Enterobactin (Ent). However, Ent is bound by the host protein Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), preventing bacterial reuptake of aferric or ferric Ent.  In two experiments we treated A549 (lung cancer cell line) cells with Lcn2, Ent, and iron, alone and in combination. more...

752. Expression profiling of Aldh1l1-precursors in the developing spinal cord reveals glial lineage-specific genes and direct Sox9-Nfe2l1 interactions
(Submitter supplied) Developmental regulation of gliogenesis in the mammalian CNS is incompletely understood, in part due to a limited repertoire of lineage-specific genes. We used Aldh1l1-GFP as a marker for gliogenic radial glia and later-stage precursors of developing astrocytes and performed gene expression profiling of these cells. We then used this dataset to identify candidate transcription factors that may serve as glial markers or regulators of glial fate. more...

(Submitter supplied) We report that ancestral zinc-finger-domain transcriptional regulators, previously  reported to control virulence/symbiosis, implement a cell cycle (S→G1) transcriptional  switch. To unravel how this G1-phase transcriptional program is reinstated during a  primitive cell cycle, we first defined G1-specific promoters in the model bacterium  Caulobacter crescentus by comparative ChIP-Seq analysis. We then exploited one  such promoter as genetic proxy, to identify two conserved developmental regulator  paralogs, MucR1/2, that constitute a quadripartite and homeostatic regulatory module  directing the switch from S→G1-phase transcription. more...

777. Programming and inheritance of parental DNA methylomes in mammals
(Submitter supplied) The reprogramming of parental methylomes is essential for embryonic development. In mammals, paternal 5-methylcytosines (5mCs) have been proposed to be actively converted to oxidized bases. These paternal oxidized bases and maternal 5mCs are believed to be passively diluted by cell divisions. By generating single-base resolution, allele-specific DNA methylomes from mouse gametes, early embryos, and primordial germ cell (PGC), as well as single-base-resolution maps of oxidized cytosine bases for early embryos, we report the existence of 5hmC and 5fC in both maternal and paternal genomes and find that 5mC or its oxidized derivatives, at the majority of demethylated CpGs, are converted to unmodified cytosines independent of passive dilution from gametes to four-cell embryos. more...

784. Gene repression by sigmaS: sigma competition for binding to RNA polymerase or more?
(Submitter supplied) The alternative subunit of RNA polymerase RpoS/σS controls a global adaptive response allowing many Gram-negative bacteria to survive nutrient deprivation and various stresses and contributes to biofilm formation and virulence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We have addressed an important but poorly understood aspect of σS-dependent control; that of a repressor. The general assumption is that negative regulation of gene expression by σS is mainly a passive phenomenon, due to competition between σS and other sigma factors for binding to a limited amount of core RNA polymerase (RNAP). more...

791. Identification of Sleep Regulatory Genes in Flies Mutant for the Clock Gene cycle
(Submitter supplied) Extended periods of waking result in physiological impairments in humans, rats, and flies. Sleep homeostasis, the increase in sleep observed following sleep loss, is believed to counter the negative effects of prolonged waking by restoring vital biological processes that are degraded during sleep deprivation. Sleep homeostasis, as with other behaviors, is influenced by both genes and environment. We report here that during periods of starvation, flies remain spontaneously awake but, in contrast to sleep deprivation, do not accrue any of the negative consequences of prolonged waking. more...

(Submitter supplied) Dicer is a central enzymatic player in RNA interference (RNAi) pathways that acts to regulate gene expression in nearly all eukaryotes. Although the cytoplasmic function of Dicer is well documented in mammals, there is little known about any possible nuclear function.  Here we show that Dicer is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, but that its nuclear levels are tightly regulated. In its nuclear manifestation Dicer interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at actively-transcribed gene loci. more...

797. Loss of HDAC11 leads to reduced secretion of MCP-1 and less severe EAE
(Submitter supplied) HDAC11 regulates IL-10 expression and overexpression of HDAC11 in antigen presenting cells (APCs) leads to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Conversely, loss of HDAC11 leads to upregulation of IL-10 and immune tolerance. HDAC11 overexpression is also associated with inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis. Hence we wished to determine the inflammatory mediators regulated by HDAC11. We used microarray to determine gene expression profile of macrophages from WT and HDAC11 knockout mice.

816. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 3 (VEGFR3) controls hippocampal neural stem cell conversion into progenitor cells
(Submitter supplied) Neural stem cells (NSCs) continuously produce new neurons within the adult mammalian hippocampus. However, this process declines with age and this decline correlates with defects in cognitive function and mood. Molecular mechanisms that activate quiescent NSCs to generate progenitor cells in vivo remain poorly understood. Here we show that adult hippocampal NSCs express VEGFR3, a key regulator of vascular and neural development, and are activated by the VEGFR3 ligand VEGF-C to enter the cell cycle and convert into progenitor cells. more...

818. MeDIP-chip from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissue from wildtype mice, for 5-methyl-cytosine
(Submitter supplied) Nerve injury in the peripheral  nervous system allows spontaneous regeneration, in contrast to injury of central nerves, which lead to a differential expression pattern of regeneration-associated genes and others. These genes might be regulated by promoter DNA methylation As regeneration model, DRG tissue was analyzed for methyated gene promoters and CpG islands following both injury types. A differential methylation pattern could be identified, although most genes remained unmethylated.

824. Contribution of natural antisense transcription to an endogenous siRNA signature in human cells
(Submitter supplied) Background: Eukaryotic cells express a complex layer of noncoding RNAs. An intriguing family of regulatory RNAs includes transcripts from the opposite strand of protein coding genes, so called natural antisense transcripts (NATs). Here, we test the hypothesis that antisense transcription triggers RNA interference and gives rise to endogenous short RNAs (endo-siRNAs).  Methods/Results: We used cloned human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) followed by short RNAseq to investigate the small genic RNA transcriptome. more...

(Submitter supplied) Remembrances of traumata range among the most enduring forms of memories. Despite the elevated lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, effective strategies to attenuate long-term traumatic memories are scarce. The most efficacious treatments to diminish recent (i.e., day-old) traumata capitalize on memory updating mechanisms during reconsolidation that are initiated upon memory recall. Here, we show that in mice successful reconsolidation-updating paradigms for recent memories fail to attenuate remote (i.e., month-old) ones. more...

889. m6A-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification present in the mRNA of all higher eukaryotes. Here we present that m6A is selectively recognized by human YTH domain family (YTHDF2) protein to regulate mRNA degradation. By using crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, we have identified over 4000 substrate RNA of YTHDF2 with conserved core motif of G(m6A)C. We further estabilshed the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism by a combination of ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, m6A level quantification and cell-based imaging: the C-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6A of mRNA and the N-terminal domain is responsive for localizing mRNA from translatable pool to processing body where mRNA decay occurs.

898. Chip-chip from Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens with H3K27me3
(Submitter supplied) Epigenetic changes commonly occur in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and are associated with aberrant gene expression. Recently, we demonstrated the pivotal role of abnormal H3K4me3 methylation, which is catalyzed by the menin/MLL, a TrxG family, in HCC development. Meanwhile, there is clear evidence that increasing global levels of H3K27me3 are activated in human primary HCC. To further elucidate the functional relatedness of the repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 histone remodeling in HCC, we performed H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 ChIP-on-chip screen using three HCC specimens and their adjacent tissues.

901. The human cap-binding complex is functionally connected to the nuclear RNA exosome
(Submitter supplied) Nuclear processing and quality control of eukaryotic RNA is mediated by the multi-subunit RNA exosome, which utilizes accessory factors to regulate its enzymatic activity. However, the mechanism of exosome recruitment to its ribonucleoprotein (RNP) targets remains poorly understood. Here we disclose a physical link between the human nuclear RNA exosome and the cap-binding complex (CBC). The CBC associates with the ARS2 protein to form CBC-ARS2 (CBCA), and then further connects together with the uncharacterized ZC3H18/NHN1 protein to the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, forming CBC-NEXT (CBCN). more...

For small capped RNAs like pre-snRNAs, the CBC recruits PHAX. Here, we identify the CBCAP complex, composed of CBC, Ars2 and PHAX, and show that both CBCAP and CBC-Ars2 complexes can be reconstituted from recombinant proteins. Ars2 stimulates PHAX binding to the CBC as well as snRNAs 3'-end processing, hereby coupling maturation with export. more...

955. Global gene expression pattern difference between the high density and the regular density cultured rat bone marrow cells
(Submitter supplied) In vitro expansion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) remains a challenge in stem cell research and its application. We hypothesize that high density culture is able to expansion EPCs from bone marrow by mimicking cell-cell interactions of the bone marrow niche. To test the hypothesis, rat bone marrow cells were either cultured in high density by seeding or cultured in regular density. Flow cytometric analyses of the cells cultured for 15 days showed that high density cells exhibited smaller cell size and higher levels of marker expression related to EPCs when compared to regular density cultured cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) In most organisms, meiotic recombination begins with programmed DNA double strand  break (DSB) formation by Spo11. Here, we present evidence that Tel1/Mec1, the  budding yeast ATM/ATR, regulate DSB formation by phosphorylating Rec114, an  essential Spo11-accessory protein. Analyses of a non-phosphorylatable- or phosphomimetic-  alleles of rec114 revealed that DSB-dependent phosphorylation of Rec114  limited its association with DSB-hotspots resulting in reduction in DSB formation. more...

(Submitter supplied) TRIM28 (KAP1 - KRAB-associated protein 1) is critical for the silencing of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here, we reveal that an essential impact of this process is the protection of cellular gene expression in early embryos from perturbation by cis-acting activators contained within these genetic invaders. In TRIM28-depleted ES cells, repressive chromatin marks at ERVs are replaced by histone modifications typical of active enhancers, stimulating transcription of nearby cellular genes, notably those harboring bivalent promoters. more...

(Submitter supplied) Background. Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive and irreversible and they can be originated by mutations in specific genes. Spalt-like genes (Sall) encode transcription factors expressed in the central nervous system. In humans, SALL mutations are associated with hereditary syndromes characterized by mental retardation, sensorineural deafness and motoneuron problems, among others. Drosophila sall mutants exhibit severe neurodegeneration of the Central Nervous System, which surprisingly reverts later in development, suggesting a potential to recover from neurodegeneration. more...

(Submitter supplied) EGFRvA is a novel and widely-expressed EGFR isoform, whose upregulation is positively related to glioma grades. Intriguingly, it is the upregulation of EGFRvA but not EGFR that significantly correlates with a poor prognosis in glioma patients. Cancer cells expressing EGFRvA (relative to EGFR) display a higher invasive capacity and a lower sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). To investigate the significant differently expressed genes between U87MG EGFRvA cells and U87MG EGFR cells，microarray experiments were conducted.

1082. HSF1 mediated Gene regulation in T cells at normal (37C) and febrile (40C) temperatures
(Submitter supplied) HSF1 is a major transcriptional regulator of heat shock responses. Many cells activate HSF1 in response to heat shock temperatures (>42oC) and other cellular stress causing agents. Unlike other cell types, T cells activate HSF1 in response to T cell activation or when exposed to febrile (40oC) temperatures, suggesting a role for HSF1 beyond the heat-shock response. We used microarray analysis and HSF1 knock-out mice to study the HSF1 mediated gene regulation in activated T cells under normal and fever temperatures.

1088. Genome-wide Profiling of Progesterone Receptor and GATA2 Binding in the Mouse Uterus [ChIP-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Progesterone (P4) signaling through its nuclear transcription factor, the progesterone receptor (PR), is essential for normal uterine function.  Although deregulation of PR mediated signaling is known to underscore uterine dysfunction and a number of endometrial pathologies, the early molecular mechanisms of this deregulation are unclear. To address this issue, we have defined the genome-wide PR and GATA2 cistrome in the murine uterus using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). more...

1089. Unraveling the KNOTTED1 regulatory network in maize meristems
(Submitter supplied) KNOTTED1(KN1)-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factors function in plant meristems, self-renewing structures consisting of stem cells and their immediate daughters. Despite their importance for plant development, the genomic network targeted by KNOX proteins is poorly understood. Using ChIP-seq, we defined the KN1 cistrome in maize inflorescences and found that KN1 binds to several thousand loci. To understand how these binding occupancies correlate with changes in transcriptional regulation, we performed RNA-seq on immature ears and tassels, and compared expression profiles between normal and loss-of-function kn1 plants, in addition to immature leaves from normal and gain-of-function Kn1 plants. We found that 643 of the KN1 targets were modulated in one or multiple tissues, with a strong enrichment for transcription factors (including other homeobox genes) and genes participating in several hormonal pathways, most significantly auxin, implicating KN1 at the crossroads of plant hormone signaling. The loss-of-function kn1 phenotype is reminiscent of auxin mutants and kn1 mis-expression in leaves correlates with increased auxin signaling. Our results demonstrate that KN1 plays a key role in orchestrating the upper levels of a hierarchical gene regulatory network that impacts plant meristem identity and function.

(Submitter supplied) Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells in response to NGF is a prototypical model in which signal duration determines a biological response. Sustained ERK activity induced by NGF, as compared to transient activity induced by EGF, is critical to the differentiation of these cells. To characterize the transcriptional program activated preferentially by NGF, we compared global gene expression profiles between cells treated with NGF and EGF for 2-4 hrs, when sustained ERK signaling in response to NGF is most distinct from the transient signal elicited by EGF. more...

To evaluate this relationship we investigated VEGF signaling in endothelial cells with disrupted FGF signaling in vitro and in vivo. We find that endothelial cells lacking FGF signaling become unresponsive to VEGF due to down regulation of VEGFR2 expression caused by reduced Vegfr2 enhancer activation, which is in turn caused by reduced activation of Ets family transcription factors. more...

1189. Expression data from mouse neonatal ovarian DMBA and BaP culture experiments
(Submitter supplied) Mammalian females are born with a finite number of non-renewing primordial follicles, the majority of which remain in a quiescent state for many years. Due to their non-renewing nature, these “resting” oocytes are particularly vulnerable to xenobiotic insult, resulting in premature ovarian senescence and the formation of dysfunctional oocytes.  In this study we characterised the mechanisms of ovotoxicity for the ovotoxic agent 7,12-dimethylbenz-[a]anthracene (DMBA), which targets immature follicles. more...

(Submitter supplied) The liver has the unique capacity to regenerate after surgical resection. However, the regulation of liver regeneration is not completely understood. We performed miRNA microarray analyses of liver tissue from Wistar rats at different time points after 70% partial hepatectomy (0, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 hours, and 5 days) and after sham laparotomy (12, 24, and 48 hours). We demonstrate that miRNA expression patterns changed during liver regeneration and that these changes were most evident during the peak of DNA replication at 24 hours after resection. more...

(Submitter supplied) The immune response to Neisseria gonorrhoeae is poorly understood, but its extensive antigenic variability and resistance to complement are thought to allow it to evade destruction by the host’s immune defenses.  We propose that N. gonorrhoeae also avoids inducing protective immune responses in the first place.  We previously found that N. gonorrhoeae induces IL-17-dependent innate responses in mice and suppresses Th1/Th2-dependent adaptive responses in murine cells in vitro through the induction of TGF-β. more...

We used Affymetrix gene expression analysis to monitor changes in three regions of the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, DG) of middle aged (18 months) and old (28 month) rats that were exposed to dietary restriction. Old rats were determined to be good performers (GP) or poor performers (PP) in behavioral tests to assess thier hippocampal function.

1264. Do different neurons age differently? Direct genome-wide analysis of aging in single identified cholinergic neurons
(Submitter supplied) The complexity of events associated with age-related memory loss (ARML) cannot be overestimated. The problem is further complicated by the enormous diversity of neurons in the CNS and even synapses of one neuron within a neural circuit. Large-scale single-neuron analysis is not only challenging but mostly impractical for any model currently used in ARML. We simply do not know: do all neurons and synapses age differently or are some neurons (or synapses) more resistant to aging than others? What is happening in any given neuron while it undergoes “normal” aging? What are the genomic changes that make aging apparently irreversible?  What would be the balance between neuron-specific vs global genome-wide changes in aging? In the proposed paper we address these questions and develop a new model to study the entire scope of genomic and epigenomic regulation in aging at the resolution of single functionally characterized cells and even cell compartments. more...

1336. STAT4 ChIP-on-chip in IL12-Mediated T Helper 1 Cell Differentiation
(Submitter supplied) The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription factor STAT4 is a critical component in the development of inflammatory adaptive immune responses. It has been extensively characterized as a lineage-determining factor in Th1 development. However, the genetic program activated by STAT4 that results in an inflammatory cell type is not well defined. In this report we use DNA isolated from STAT4-chromatin immunoprecipitation to perform ChIP-on-chip analysis of over 28,000 mouse gene promoters to identify STAT4 targets. more...

1337. DRG co-culture microarray
(Submitter supplied) Gene regulatory interactions that shape developmental processes can often can be inferred from microarray analysis of gene expression, but most computational methods used require extensive datasets that can be difficult to generate. Here, we show that maximumentropy network analysis allows extraction of genetic interactions from limited microarray datasets. Maximum-entropy networks indicated that the inflammatory cytokine TNF-_ plays a pivotal role in Schwann cell–axon interactions, and these data suggested that TNF mediates its effects by orchestrating cytoplasmic movement and axon guidance. more...

1344. Distinctive Chromatin in Human Sperm Packages Genes that Guide Embryo Development: ChIP-chip
(Submitter supplied) As nucleosomes are widely replaced by protamine in mature human sperm, epigenetic   contributions to embryo development appear limited.  However, our genome-wide approaches find nucleosomes at low levels genome-wide, but also significantly enriched at imprinted gene clusters, miRNA clusters, HOX gene clusters, and the promoters of other developmental transcription and signaling factors. Developmental promoters were often DNA hypomethylated, and bore histone modifications localized to discrete locations: H3K4me2 is enriched at certain developmental promoters, whereas large blocks of H3K4me3 localize to a subset of developmental promoters, regions in HOX loci, certain non-coding RNAs, and generally to paternally-expressed imprinted loci. more...

1373. U1 Adaptors: a new gene silencing technology
(Submitter supplied) The goal of the microarray experiment was to do a head-to-head comparison of the U1 Adaptor technology with siRNA in terms of specificity at the genome-wide level.  U1 Adaptors represent a novel gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct from antisense and RNA interference (RNAi).  The U1 Adaptor is a bifunctional oligonucleotide having a “Target Domain” that is complementary to a site in the target gene's terminal exon and a “U1 Domain” that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor. more...

These studies provided valuable first clues to molecular changes in ovarian cancer that might be exploited in new treatment strategies. However, most studies were of relatively limited size and the number of overlapping genes in the identified profiles was minimal. Although identification of gene expression profiles associated with clinically relevant subtypes in ovarian cancer is important, knowledge is now emerging rapidly on how genes interact in pathways, networks and complexes; this allows us to unravel those cellular pathways determining the biological behavior of ovarian cancer, that might be successfully targeted with drugs. more...

(Submitter supplied) A fundamental question in biology is how an undifferentiated field of cells acquires spatial pattern and undergoes coordinated differentiation. The development of the vertebrate limb is an important paradigm for understanding these processes. The skeletal and connective tissues of the developing limb all derive from a population of multipotent progenitor cells located in its distal tip. During limb outgrowth, these progenitors segregate into a chondrogenic lineage, located in the center of the limb bud, and soft connective tissue lineages located in its periphery. more...

1414. Identification of transcriptional changes due to loss of Hdac3 in liver at P17 and P28
(Submitter supplied) Histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) is the enzymatic component of transcriptional repression complexes recruited by the nuclear hormone receptors.  Inactivation of Hdac3 in cancer cell lines triggered apoptosis, and removal of Hdac3 in the germ-line of mice caused embryonic lethality.  Therefore, we conditionally deleted the Hdac3 allele in the mouse liver.  These mice developed hepatomegaly, which was the result of hepatocyte hypertrophy, and these morphological changes coincided with significant imbalances between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. more...

Consistent with previous work (Nicolas et al., 2006) we find that the two S. pombe proteins, which we name Swm1 and Swm2 (after SWIRM1 and SWIRM2), associate together in a complex.  We find that this complex specifically demethylates lysine 9 in histone H3 (H3K9) to up- and down-regulate expression of different genes. more...

Homozygotic mgb mice (mgb-/-) develop lower urinary tract obstruction in utero due to a lack of bladder smooth muscle differentiation. This defect is the result of a random transgene insertion into chromosome 16 followed by a translocation of this fragment into chromosome 11. In an effort to identify potential gene targets affected in mgb mice, we performed transcriptional profiling on embryonic day 15 (E15) mgb-/- bladders using both a Chromosome 11/16 Custom GeneChip Array and the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip. more...

1484. Loss of the RNA-binding protein Kep1 leads to cytokinesis defects and behavioural abnormalities in male Drosophila.
(Submitter supplied) The kep1 gene encodes an RNA-binding protein containing a single maxi-KH domain. We have previously demonstrated that loss of the kep1 gene results in Drosophila females displaying a reduction in fertility and wished to further characterize the kep1 mutation in Drosophila males. Wild-type females mated to homozygous kep1- males resulted in 6% of the eggs laid hatching. This reduced reproductive success is due in part to a meiosis defect during spermatogenesis with approximately 10 % of sperm demonstrating a defect in cytokinesis. more...
